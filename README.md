这里来自UoG,UESTC 的Godzilla队的仓库 

本仓库服务于2025年创格杯比赛 :rocket:

队伍成员是 Xuezhi Lou, Zhiqi Qiu, Weipeng Zhang. 

> This repository is from the Godzilla team, whose members are from the Glasgow College (UoG) and the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).

> This repository serves the 2025 Chuangge Cup Competition.

我们的作品是一个二轮平衡小车，可以实现自稳定，前进后退，拐弯画圈等基本功能，也可远程控制. 

> Our work is a two-wheeled self-balancing cart, which can achieve basic functions such as self-stabilization, forward and backward movement, turning and circle-drawing, and can also be controlled remotely.

我们的软件基于 STM32 HAL库，使用 CubeMX 做初始化. 使用的芯片是 STM32F104C8T6

> Our software is based on the STM32 HAL library and uses CubeMX for initialization. The chip used is STM32F104C8T6.

主要应用了PID控制技术，卡尔曼滤波 等技术

> It mainly applies technologies such as PID control and Kalman filtering.

这也是我们的第一个 嵌入式项目！ :beer: :beer: :beer: 

> It is also our first embedded project！ :beer: :beer: :beer:
